        "question": "Do you offer same-day edits?",
        "answer": "Although we do offer same-day edits, it is not something we recommend because a hurried edit may take away from the soul of a trailer. However if you wish to hire this service, you can have a look at some of our past work here:"

        "question": "How soon will I get my film?",
        "answer": "You could get a trailer on the very day of your wedding, or depending on how busy we've been... The feature film could take us between six to twelve months to create whereas the mini-series could take between to three to six months. But we've been told it's worth the wait!"

        "question": "Can we hire another videographer along with TWF?",
        "answer": "We like to shoot very unobtrusively, without scripting, rehearsing or making you conscious of our presence and it's hard to do so when you have lights, and cameras all over you. We also insist on not more than two photographers. That way you'll get the best of both!"

        "question": "Are the prices negotiable?",

        "answer": "Yes we do! All over the world in fact, but you'll have to get us there and give us a place to sleep! However if you keep checking our Facebook page, you'll be able to track us across the globe! We could be in your country when your big day is near!"

        "question": "Can I Select The Music For My Wedding Video ?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can. It's your wedding so the the key of the specialty lies within your choices which can only turn the album telling 'your story'. We positively recommend you to let us know if there is any special background music of your taste to put behind your tale. Nothing to worry even if you don't come up with, we will surely do the best we can to exceed your expectations anyway."

        "question": "Would You Be Sharing Our Wedding Pictures On Your Social Media Channels ? What If I Do Not Want That ? Do You Allow Any Changes After Confirmation Of Booking ?",
        "answer": "After you've done your advance payments your plans get fixed in our enlisted schedule list. If there is any tiny changes in events or its styles you have to let us know that. However, we don't usually afford big changes, like change of committed date can happen due to unavailability of venue that day. It only can be possible if there is any vacancy on your replaced date otherwise we won't be able to help you any further and according to agreements, the advanced payment of booking is also non-refundable."
